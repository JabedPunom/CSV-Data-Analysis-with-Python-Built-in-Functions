# CSV Data Analysis with Python Built-in Functions
 In this project, I demonstrate how to perform various operations on CSV data using only Python built-in functions and data structures. I use a CSV data file (task1.csv) that contains several columns of numerical values as an example, but the functions I developed can work for other CSV files as well.The operations I perform include:  Reading a single specified column of data from a CSV file and returning the column name and a list of data values. Reading all columns of data from a CSV file and storing them in a dictionary, where each key-value pair corresponds to a column name and a list of data values. Calculating the Kendall Tau Rank Correlation Coefficient for two lists of data, which measures the degree of similarity between the rankings of the data values in the lists. Generating a list of tuples containing the Kendall Tau Rank Correlation Coefficients for every pair of columns in the CSV data file. Printing a custom table showing the Kendall Tau Rank Correlation Coefficients for a subset of the column pairs, using a specified border character and padding for readability. This project showcases my Python skills and my ability to work with CSV data, dictionaries, lists, and statistical methods. I also learn how to use the open, readline, split, len, range, append, zip, sorted, count, format, join, try, and except functions in Python.
